# ppm2usb
PPM signal to USB Virtual Joystick

This is a test project with the scope of reading PPM signal from a Spektrum DX5e 5 channel controller (https://www.spektrumrc.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdId=SPM5500).

The uController used for this is Digispark development board (http://digistump.com/products/1).

Please consider this project “For Educational Purposes Only” since a proper implementation using this uC is not possible because of HW limitations.
Since Attiny85 based microcontroller used in this development boards, lacks USB support this is done using the software implementation "DigiJoystick" (also based on V-USB)
